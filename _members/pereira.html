<p><b>Current Research Summary:</b> </p>
<p>Transit spectroscopy and multi-band photometry has been so far conducted using general-purpose, space-based instruments. 
These measurements however suffer from a high level of systematic error due to issues such as pointing jitter, thermal and 
opto-mechanical stability, wavelength and photometric calibration, and detector stability. Testing and calibration of high 
precision photometers for the detection of planetary transits requires a light source which photometric stability must be 
better than the goal stability of the photometer to be tested.</p>

<p>My project aims to research and develop a device that senses the light source fluctuations and modulates the beam, 
both in flux and in spectra, to produce a sufficiently stable source, a truly impressive challenge when stabilization 
levels of few ppm are required over long periods of observation.</p>
