<h1> Musings On Student Supervision</h1>

<p>At the NYRIA meeting in Leiden in 2018, I had the ‘brilliant’ idea to give a talk on student-supervisor relations. 
Now, this is a complex topic, which I’m really not qualified to speak about, particularly as I’ve had no formal training, 
but as a new supervisor I really wanted to discuss it with other people.  It turned out to be a brilliant idea; 
if you want to learn about how to supervise people, ask the people who are being supervised about their relationship 
with their supervisor and how it could be improved. For the rest that follows here, these are my opinions, formed from 
my supervision experience, from presenting that talk and chatting to the attendees at the meeting. If you want a more 
solid scientific basis, a really nice place to start is (see footnote). The main message I got from it is the supervisor 
student relationship can seriously influence a PhD. </p>
